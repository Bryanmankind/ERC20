**ERC20 Token Contract**

This repository contains the code for an ERC20 token contract developed from scratch.

### Overview

The ERC20 standard is a set of rules and functions that allow for the implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract adheres to the ERC20 standard, enabling the creation and management of tokens that can be transferred and traded on the Ethereum network.

### Features

- **ERC20 Compliance**: This contract follows the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum infrastructure and wallets.
- **Token Creation**: Allows for the creation of a new ERC20 token with customizable parameters such as name, symbol, and initial supply.
- **Token Transfer**: Enables users to transfer tokens between Ethereum addresses.
- **Token Approval**: Facilitates token approval for delegated transfers, allowing other addresses to spend tokens on behalf of the token owner.
- **Token Balance Inquiry**: Provides functions to check the balance of tokens for a specific Ethereum address.
- **Event Logging**: Logs events for token transfers, approvals, and other key actions, facilitating transparency and auditability.
